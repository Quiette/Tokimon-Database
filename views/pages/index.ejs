<h4 align=left;>What is a Tokimon?</h4>
A Tokimon is a rare creature found in the remote areas of Korea. For the most part, they
resemble rabbits and the only form of communication they have with us is the ability to say
their own name. Tokimons come in all shapes and sizes, have special abilities, and tend to fight
with each other on occasion. Each Tokimon could have the ability to fly, fight, throw fire, spray
water, electrify, and freeze other Tokimons.</p>
<br>
<h4 align=left;>Why do Tokimons need trainers?</h4>
Because they are such primitive creatures but have such extraordinary abilities, they
need Tokimon trainers. The trainer's is job to collect Tokimons and use them accordingly.

<h4 align=left;>How do trainers level up?</h4>
A trainer starts at level 0, and gains a level after every 5 tokimons they catch. For example: to hit level 3, 
a trainer would need at least 15 Tokimons. Trainers will lose levels if their Tokimon count goes below the level threshold.
